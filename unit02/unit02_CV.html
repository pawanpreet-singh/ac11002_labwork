      <section>
        <p>Due to graduate in 2017,
          I have acquired technical knowledge and
          skills from my course as well as practical
           and business skills from my industrial year in
           a software company in Germany. I have used a range of
           languages, operating systems and development tools as well
            as experiencing the system development life cycle. Specialising
            in mobile technology, I am keen to develop as a graduate trainee
             in software development.</p>
