        <h2>Brexit: UK 'ready to welcome EU' to continue trade talks</h2>
        <p>The two sides' chief negotiators, Lord David Frost and Michel Barnier, spoke on the phone earlier after talks stalled last week.

          Following the conversation, Downing Street said the pair had "jointly agreed a set of principles for handling this intensified phase of talks".

          Lord Frost said talks would begin again in London on Thursday.</p>

        <h2>Covid: Greater Manchester given £60m support package</h2>
        <p> £60m support package for businesses affected by new coronavirus restrictions in Greater Manchester will be distributed across the region.

          Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed the government will be giving the extra funding as the region goes into the highest tier on Friday.

          The move follows a breakdown in talks with local leaders who requested £90m but lowered their demand to £65m.</p>
